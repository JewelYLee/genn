synaptic plasticity

load optimisation?

pthreads

mpi

Fix Poisson neuron firing rates (currently depend on the time step & arbitrary scale)

Find a more elegant way to set synapse grid sizes for sparse and mixed sparse/dense connectivities (consider defining grid size values as variables)

Consider the option to use zero-copy memory for g arrays in bigger networks to save from the global memory

There is no point in using an Epre (in synapse parameter) which is smaller than Vspike (which is the case with the MBody example).

Do STDP in reverse order, as it cannot enter the first two cases (or use switch-case).
