make sure the chosen device is actually chosen in the generated code (!)

add code to optimise block size (generateRunner)

synaptic plasticity

load optimisation?

pthreads

mpi

migrate from pre-allocated memory structures to dynamically allocated ones?

Calculate explicit input from the input role on the GPU

If learning is used with globalg, initgraw can be optimised (using an array now while one val derived from globalg would be enough)

test delayed synapses with learning
